# Ensolvers
Here I code a to do list for Ensolvers

Angular CLI: 13.2.3
Node: 16.14.0
Package Manager: npm 8.3.1
OS: win32 x64
.Net core 5 
SQL Server v18.10

port allowed for Angular server "https://localhost:4200"

The api contains login but i'd comment it cause I needed more time to implement it.
